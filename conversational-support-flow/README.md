# Conversational Customer Support Agent

A conversational customer support assistant built on CrewAI's conversational flows. An LLM router sends each incoming message to the route that fits it (a deterministic order lookup, a RAG answer over the return policy, or a live web search crew), and conversation state carries across turns so follow-ups and pronouns resolve. The running flow streams to a custom chat UI over the AG-UI protocol.

We use:

- [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/) for multi-agent orchestration (the conversational flow, router, and crews)
- [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) for streaming the running agent to the browser
- [CopilotKit](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/) for the React chat runtime
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) as the LLM provider
- [Exa](https://exa.ai/) for live web search
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) + [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) for the agent server

## How It Works

1. Open the chat UI and send a message about an order, a return, or a shipping question
2. A router LLM (`gpt-4o-mini`) classifies the message into one of the flow's routes. The route catalog is built automatically from each handler's docstring
3. The matched route handles the turn:
   - **ORDER_LOOKUP**: deterministic lookup against the order database (status, carrier, tracking, delivery date); no agent
   - **RETURN_POLICY**: a single agent Crew runs real RAG over the return policy knowledge base and answers in plain language
   - **RESEARCH**: a two agent Crew (researcher plus communicator) uses Exa web search for live conditions (carrier delays, weather) and rewrites the findings for the customer
   - **converse**: a plain conversational reply for everything else, answered from history when possible
4. Conversation state (last order id, message history) persists across turns within a session, so pronouns and follow-ups resolve ("Has that arrived yet?", "What was the order number again?")
5. The flow streams over AG-UI to the custom chat UI (built on CopilotKit's runtime) in the browser

> **Demo scope:** the order database, return policy knowledge base, and web search stand in for real systems. There is no authentication, so `ORDER_LOOKUP` resolves any known order id typed into the chat. A production build would scope order lookups to an authenticated customer and return the same "not found" reply for unknown and unauthorized orders alike.

## Set Up

### Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_openrouter_api_key>
EXA_API_KEY=<your_exa_api_key>
```

### Install Dependencies

Backend (Python 3.12, via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

Frontend (Node.js):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run the App

Start the backend (serves the flow at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversation`):

```bash
uvicorn server:app --port 8000
```

In a second terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). Ask about an order (try order `4471`), a return, or a shipping delay to trigger each route.
